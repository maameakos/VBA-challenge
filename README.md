Stock Data Analysis
This repository contains a VBA script that performs stock analysis on a dataset containing information about multiple stocks for one year. The script loops through each worksheet representing a year in an Excel workbook and outputs the following information for each stock:

Ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
Percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
Total stock volume of the stock
Additionally, the script has been adjusted to enable it to run on every worksheet (representing every year) at once.
